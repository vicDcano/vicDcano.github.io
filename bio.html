                    <p class = "bio-text">
                        My name is Victor David Cano, and I have been a software engineer for 4 years, focusing on Virtual Reality development.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "bio-text">
                        I have a background in using the Unity game engine for more than 7 years, learning game development on my own, and at the same time, I have picked up experience with C# to do a few personal gaming projects and my main research project.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "bio-text">
                        Over the course of my software engineering career, I have been well-experienced and have basic knowledge of other programming languages. I am someone who loves to learn, pick things up easily, and quickly get the basics down. For example, this website I built was self-taught and randomly picked up along the way to showcase my hard work, my dedication to improving, and my willingness to put the things I learn to use right away. I have more details about this personal website in the project link on the home page.
                    </p>

                        If you wish to see a resume, please click the contact button in the home page and fill out the form. I do not like having more of my personal information easily downloaded. Thank you!
